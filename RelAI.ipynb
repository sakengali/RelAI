The EV market is indeed expanding, but the US's electric vehicle 'revolution' appears to be happening much slower than some analysts and car manufacturers expected.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since 2016, sales of EVs in the US have grown – from nearly 65,000 vehicles sold in 2017, to more than 800,000 vehicles in 2022. Data from auto analytics firm Motor Intelligence showed EV sales rose 51% in the first half of 2023, following the upwards trend. However, those gains are still a drop from last year's 71% growth in the same timeframe. And Tesla, which leads the market with more than half of all EV sales, recently reported its lowest quarterly earnings in two years, leading to a $138bn (£111.4bn) drop in the company's stock value.\n",

At Ford, executives are delaying billions of dollars in EV investment, saying they don't yet need the production capacity to meet demand.\n",

            "We may think of empires as stationary entities that build cities, palaces and courts to maintain their rule, but some nomadic kingdoms were incredibly robust. Predating the famed Genghis Khan empire by about 1,000 years, the Xiongnu empire lasted from the 2nd Century BCE to the late 1st Century CE and occupied the territory of modern-day Mongolia with its northern borders stretching all the way to Lake Baikal in today's Russia.\n",
            "\n",
            "Besides being skilled warriors, Xiongnu were also avid purveyors of luxury goods, which they acquired from across Eurasia through the trading routes of the ancient Silk Road – including Chinese silks, Roman glass and Egyptian beads. The elite Xiongnu women held important positions in society and were involved in politics. In a way, Xiongnu women were the virtual glue – or perhaps the silk ties – that held together the roaming kingdom, which didn't have permanent cities or brick-and-mortar fixtures to assert its presence.\n",

Over the course of four series, audiences were treated to the madcap adventures in suburban self-sufficiency of the titular Goods – Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (Felicity Kendal). In principle, the show was a simple yet effective comedy of manners and contrast – with the endearingly countercultural Goods and their rough-hewn, self-sufficient idyll positioned as the foil to their classically suburban neighbours, the Leadbetters, and their stuffy milieu. In retrospect, however, The Good Life – serving up, as it did, several studies of crisis, beginning with Tom's midlife one in the series premiere – was actually an unexpected harbinger of things to come in society and in sustainability.\n",

            "Authors: ['Brennan Doherty']\n",
            "Text: For some brands, the decision is motivated by their corporate values and image. Retailers that appeal to environmentally and socially conscious shoppers often don't feed this frenzy for profit. \"They just don't feel comfortable participating in a day, or in a sales promotion, that really promotes unnecessary consumption,\" says Lisa Hutcheson, managing director of retail strategy at J.C. Williams Group. \"They really want to make sure that they're staying true to their brand purpose.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Yet many of these brands aren't simply snubbing Black Friday out of the goodness of their hearts – there's cachet and even money on the other side of these decisions. Ben Steele, REI's chief customer officer, says when REI announced in 2015 that it would opt out of doing Black Friday, the resulting press attention generated more than seven billion impressions – someone hearing about REI through TV, radio, print, websites or other media. \"A lot of people became aware of REI, and what makes REI unique and special and different in that moment,\" he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond corporate values, a brand's image also drives this decision. Would it seem out of place for a business to offer sales – would it devalue the brand to do so? David Soberman, professor of marketing at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, says this calculus is a factor. \"Let's assume you have an Omega watch store,\" he says, referring to the luxury Swiss watchmaker. \"How often do they participate in Black Friday? The answer is never – and it has to do with brand fit.\" Brands including Apple and Tiffany's also decline to participate for similar reasons.\n",

            "Aside from reputation, for some stores, Black Friday simply isn't a practical business move.\n",
            "\n",
            "Part of the strategy of Black Friday, says Soberman, is using rock-bottom prices on select premium products to lure in customers to spend money on other goods they might not otherwise consider buying, many of which aren't on sale. This works well for retailers with high volumes and massive distribution networks, even if they take a loss on the deeply discounted items.\n",

Marcela Coll is climbing and twirling on a black aerial silk hanging from the eaves at her circus school Circodromo. Coll slides gracefully down onto the mats and heads for the thermos of hot water and a drinking vessel filled with dried yerba mate leaves, pours some water over the leaves, sips the resulting hot, light-green liquid through a metal bombilla (straw), and then pours more water over the leaves.

The leaves are placed inside a bowl- or cup-shaped drinking vessel, also called a \"mate\", which can be made from a variety of materials: a dried, hollowed-out gourd called a calabaza, wood, metal, leather-covered glass or silicone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hot water (ideally at 75C/167F so as not to burn the leaves) is poured onto the leaves from a thermos or kettle, and the water is sipped through the metal straw. The drinker sips several times until they hear a little slurping sound called a ruidito indicating there's no liquid left in the mate, which means it's time to pour on more water and pass the vessel on to another person. Some add lemon or orange peel, mint or verbena, while others, more controversially, add sugar, honey, coffee powder or even whiskey.\n",

In fact, one might say that mate is the \"beverage of champions\".

            "Text: Some experts caution that the current noise-reducing measures may not be sufficient to protect an already stressed harbour porpoise population from the wider impact of ever bigger wind farms and turbines, with more intense construction noise.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"We're not starting with a healthy population. These animals have been living under a very high strain for decades,\" says Ursula Siebert, a veterinarian and professor of zoology, and director of the Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hannover, Germany. She and her team have been closely monitoring the harbour porpoises in the Baltic and North seas for decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "Siebert lists a range of human-made threats that have affected the population, such as entanglement in fishing gear, marine pollution, marine litter, and the loss of food sources because of fishing in their habitat. In 2019, a group of stranded porpoises in the Baltic Sea were found to have lethal blast injuries, after a controlled explosion of British mines left over from World War Two. Siebert points out that while porpoises can generally live for more than 20 years, in the Baltic Sea the average life span for females is just under four years, and in the North Sea, just under six years. \"The animals in our waters die far too early,\" she says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wind farm noise adds another potential stressor, according to Siebert – and not just during the pile-driving phase, but also potentially from ship traffic to maintain the turbines. Even the bubble curtain comes with noise: \"The bubble curtain doesn't just appear, it has to be transported there, and installed, and that has an impact of its own. If it were only 100 turbines, it wouldn't be so bad, it would happen and then be over. But now there's hardly a recovery phase, because there's so much pile-driving, and so much more is planned.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "In her view, there needs to be a more honest and open debate about the state of the porpoise population, and the impact of human activity. This may also mean putting more emphasis on the need to save energy, \"so we don't push further and further into wildlife habitats\" by building new wind farms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Juretzek, at Germany's regulating agency, says there is a difficult balance between expanding the wind farms and minimising their impact. But she also highlights that climate change poses an existential threat to marine life. \"Rising temperatures in marine habitats are a really relevant point,\" says Juretzek. \"After all, if you look at it from a global point of view, expanding the renewable energy sector and producing sustainable energy benefits the marine environment. With that in mind, we do need to facilitate this expansion, but in a way that's as kind to wildlife as possible.\"\n",

            "Text: It involves collecting, for example, meteorological data as well as carrying out multiple interviews with indigenous people who have lived a long time in a particular place. Comments with group consensus would then be classified in a database. Entries in this database could catalogue anything from observations about wind speed and temperature to animal behaviour. Such standardisation could help to make such information, though admittedly stripped of its colour and richness, appealing to climate researchers and international bodies such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says Reyes-García.\n",

            "Listening carefully can reveal the true depth of the challenges faced by indigenous communities, too — so by recording their observations of climate change, there is an opportunity to work on climate justice. \"I see my culture starting to disappear,\" is how one indigenous participant in a 2022 study described the severity of change. The paper resulted from a two-day workshop attended by elders, knowledge holders and young adults (ages 19 to 30) from 12 Anishinaabe communities around the Great Lakes region.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of those communities, the Magnetawan First Nation, had the initial idea for an information-gathering session. \"They just said, 'Hey, this is something we're concerned about. Can you organise something?'\" says lead author Allyson Menzies, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Guelph. As Menzies and her coauthors reported, the 37 participants discussed a range of effects they had noticed, such as how strawberries were appearing later in the year — July rather than June — and how fish spawning, which used to last a month, now continues for only about two and a half weeks because of rising river water temperatures.\n",
            "\n",
            "The participants also said that passing on traditional harvesting and hunting techniques was becoming difficult since these depend on the climate behaving in a way that it no longer does. This concept of evaporating culture is familiar to many indigenous people. Inuit communities on Baffin Island, Canada, for instance, frequently report that, as temperatures soar, they are finding it harder to predict the weather, navigate the ice and pass on hunting skills to younger members.\n",
            "\n",
            "In that sense, we might miss something important if we treat research involving indigenous communities as merely an exercise in filling in cells on a giant spreadsheet, says Ben Orlove, an anthropologist at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored an article about climate anthropology in the 2020 Annual Review of Anthropology. \"I think the indigenous people are saying the whole problem with climate change is not the data gaps,\" he says. \"It's the limits in your framework.\" Speaking broadly, he says there's a tension between the Western view of the natural world as a resource to be exploited and the indigenous view of a world where humans and nature are part of one single whole.\n",

            "Text: Kinka warns that if a creek channel has degraded too far it might need assistance getting to the point where it can spill water onto the floodplain again. Near where I camp at Telegraph Creek, I see workers from the Montana Conservation Corps, an organisation putting Montana youth to work rehabilitating public and private lands, pounding barriers made of wooden posts, brush and mud in the creek to partially block water during spring runoff. The structures, known as Beaver Dam Analogues (or BDAs), slow the water, trapping sediment and raising the creek bed. It's a technique known as low-tech process-based restoration.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"We don't do it with backhoes [diggers],\" Kinka says. \"We do it with people in waders.\" Sometimes a few BDAs can raise the water table enough to get a real beaver to move in and take over.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here on Beaver Creek, this hard work wasn't necessary. What excites Kinka about the recovery here is its simplicity. \"We didn't go down there, we didn't reintroduce beavers, we didn't build BDAs. We didn't do anything,\" he tells me. \"We just put bison here. This is resilience that is inherent in the system. It just needed a little bit of a break from grazing to be able to do this all on its own.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "What's more, the creek is still improving, he says. \"Every year the creek gets a little wider, a little more meandery, a little more like a pool and less like a trench.\"\n",

            "Text: Daisy Buchanan, author of books including Insatiable and Limelight, host of the You're Booked podcast and Jilly Cooper superfan, first discovered the writer as a teenager. \"I think I was about 13 when I fell in love with Jilly's books,\" she tells BBC Culture. \"Riders and Rivals were being passed around at school, almost 20 years after they were first published, which is a testament to her power. Her stories are dramatic, extravagant, escapist tales – but while she sets her books in glamorous worlds, her characters are so vulnerable, loveable and human. It's only in Jilly-land where you get heroines who triumph while feeling self-conscious about their spots.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "As it had for millions of readers before her, the sex left a lasting impression, too. \"She was the first writer I read who talked openly about women seeking pleasure,\" says Buchanan. \"She's not the first writer to write about sex, but I think she's one of the first to show sex on the page that is tender, joyful and loving – and to say that you don't need to be perfect to seek those sexual experiences. In her stories, sex is sometimes Earth-shatteringly profound, and sometimes simply fun.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Escapist and educational?\n",
            "\n",
            "This positive attitude to sex was a huge influence when Buchanan started writing her own novels. \"My first novel, Insatiable, wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Jilly Cooper's novels,\" she says. \"Jilly's books formed my emotional sex education, and Insatiable… owes an enormous debt to Rivals and Riders. I wanted to write escapist sex with real emotions.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But while there is much to celebrate in Cooper's portrayals of sex, it wasn't always fun – or consensual. \"There are rapes that happen in Jilly's books, and it is very rare that the rapist has any kind of comeuppance,\" says Burge. In one particularly disturbing scene in Riders, Rupert coerces his wife Helen into a sexual act. \"It's a really horrible scene,\" says Burge. \"Those aspects are difficult to read now.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite Campbell-Black's frequently appalling treatment of women, he's continued to be the hero of Cooper's books. As for feminists, they are rarely sympathetic in her novels, and usually marked by their hairy legs. Cooper is, of course, of a different era– as evidenced in a recent interview with The Sunday Times. She thinks the #MeToo movement has made people too \"tense\" and \"anxious\" about sex. \"I'm quite depressed about sex at the moment. I don't think people are having nearly as much fun.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "In her fictional worlds, though, there's still plenty of fun to be had. Tackle! sees the return of Campbell-Black (now a reformed and faithful husband), who buys ailing local football club Searston Rovers and propels them to the Champions League. If it sounds like Cooper has been binging Ted Lasso and Welcome to Wrexham, her interest in football was actually sparked by a lunch with Alex Ferguson, while Searston Rovers are loosely based on her local team, Forest Green Rovers, owned by eco-millionaire Dale Vince.\n",

            "Authors: ['Chris Baraniuk']\n",
            "Text: Zip. The power's out. But on a street in India, there's a cash machine still happily dispensing banknotes. Thanks, in part, to burnt cotton. For this cash machine has a backup battery inside it – a battery that contains carbon from carefully combusted cotton.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The exact process is secret, to be honest with you,\" says Inketsu Okina, chief intelligence officer at PJP Eye, the Japanese firm that made the battery. He's not joking, either. \"The temperature is secret and atmosphere is secret. Pressure is secret,\" he continues, cagily.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okina does say that a high temperature is required, above 3,000C (5,432F). And that 1kg (2.2lbs) of cotton yields 200g (7oz) of carbon – with just 2g (0.07oz) needed for each battery cell. The firm bought a shipment of cotton in 2017 and still hasn't used all of it, says Okina.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the batteries developed by the company, together with researchers at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, carbon is used for the anode – one of the two electrodes between which flow ions, the charged particles in batteries. Ions move in one direction when the battery is charging and in the other direction when it releases energy to a device. The majority of batteries use graphite as an anode but PJP Eye argues their approach is more sustainable, since they can make anodes using waste cotton from the textile industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "With huge demand for batteries expected in the coming years, propelled by the rise of electric vehicles and large energy storage systems, some researchers and businesses are frantically developing possible alternatives to the lithium ion and graphite batteries that are commonplace today. Like PJP Eye, they argue we could be using much more sustainable and widely available materials for battery production.\n",

            "Text: Some experts caution that the current noise-reducing measures may not be sufficient to protect an already stressed harbour porpoise population from the wider impact of ever bigger wind farms and turbines, with more intense construction noise.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"We're not starting with a healthy population. These animals have been living under a very high strain for decades,\" says Ursula Siebert, a veterinarian and professor of zoology, and director of the Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hannover, Germany. She and her team have been closely monitoring the harbour porpoises in the Baltic and North seas for decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "Siebert lists a range of human-made threats that have affected the population, such as entanglement in fishing gear, marine pollution, marine litter, and the loss of food sources because of fishing in their habitat. In 2019, a group of stranded porpoises in the Baltic Sea were found to have lethal blast injuries, after a controlled explosion of British mines left over from World War Two. Siebert points out that while porpoises can generally live for more than 20 years, in the Baltic Sea the average life span for females is just under four years, and in the North Sea, just under six years. \"The animals in our waters die far too early,\" she says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wind farm noise adds another potential stressor, according to Siebert – and not just during the pile-driving phase, but also potentially from ship traffic to maintain the turbines. Even the bubble curtain comes with noise: \"The bubble curtain doesn't just appear, it has to be transported there, and installed, and that has an impact of its own. If it were only 100 turbines, it wouldn't be so bad, it would happen and then be over. But now there's hardly a recovery phase, because there's so much pile-driving, and so much more is planned.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "In her view, there needs to be a more honest and open debate about the state of the porpoise population, and the impact of human activity. This may also mean putting more emphasis on the need to save energy, \"so we don't push further and further into wildlife habitats\" by building new wind farms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Juretzek, at Germany's regulating agency, says there is a difficult balance between expanding the wind farms and minimising their impact. But she also highlights that climate change poses an existential threat to marine life. \"Rising temperatures in marine habitats are a really relevant point,\" says Juretzek. \"After all, if you look at it from a global point of view, expanding the renewable energy sector and producing sustainable energy benefits the marine environment. With that in mind, we do need to facilitate this expansion, but in a way that's as kind to wildlife as possible.\"\n",

            "Authors: ['Chris Baraniuk']\n",
            "Text: It involves collecting, for example, meteorological data as well as carrying out multiple interviews with indigenous people who have lived a long time in a particular place. Comments with group consensus would then be classified in a database. Entries in this database could catalogue anything from observations about wind speed and temperature to animal behaviour. Such standardisation could help to make such information, though admittedly stripped of its colour and richness, appealing to climate researchers and international bodies such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says Reyes-García.\n",
            "\n",
            "Knowing what is important to indigenous communities is also beneficial because it helps those involved in planning mitigation or adaptation strategies to do so appropriately, says Reyes- García.\n",
            "\n",
            "Data and a way of life\n",
            "\n",
            "Listening carefully can reveal the true depth of the challenges faced by indigenous communities, too — so by recording their observations of climate change, there is an opportunity to work on climate justice. \"I see my culture starting to disappear,\" is how one indigenous participant in a 2022 study described the severity of change. The paper resulted from a two-day workshop attended by elders, knowledge holders and young adults (ages 19 to 30) from 12 Anishinaabe communities around the Great Lakes region.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of those communities, the Magnetawan First Nation, had the initial idea for an information-gathering session. \"They just said, 'Hey, this is something we're concerned about. Can you organise something?'\" says lead author Allyson Menzies, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Guelph. As Menzies and her coauthors reported, the 37 participants discussed a range of effects they had noticed, such as how strawberries were appearing later in the year — July rather than June — and how fish spawning, which used to last a month, now continues for only about two and a half weeks because of rising river water temperatures.\n",
            "\n",
            "The participants also said that passing on traditional harvesting and hunting techniques was becoming difficult since these depend on the climate behaving in a way that it no longer does. This concept of evaporating culture is familiar to many indigenous people. Inuit communities on Baffin Island, Canada, for instance, frequently report that, as temperatures soar, they are finding it harder to predict the weather, navigate the ice and pass on hunting skills to younger members.\n",
            "\n",
            "In that sense, we might miss something important if we treat research involving indigenous communities as merely an exercise in filling in cells on a giant spreadsheet, says Ben Orlove, an anthropologist at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored an article about climate anthropology in the 2020 Annual Review of Anthropology. \"I think the indigenous people are saying the whole problem with climate change is not the data gaps,\" he says. \"It's the limits in your framework.\" Speaking broadly, he says there's a tension between the Western view of the natural world as a resource to be exploited and the indigenous view of a world where humans and nature are part of one single whole.\n",

            "Authors: ['Christopher J Preston']\n",
            "Text: Kinka warns that if a creek channel has degraded too far it might need assistance getting to the point where it can spill water onto the floodplain again. Near where I camp at Telegraph Creek, I see workers from the Montana Conservation Corps, an organisation putting Montana youth to work rehabilitating public and private lands, pounding barriers made of wooden posts, brush and mud in the creek to partially block water during spring runoff. The structures, known as Beaver Dam Analogues (or BDAs), slow the water, trapping sediment and raising the creek bed. It's a technique known as low-tech process-based restoration.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"We don't do it with backhoes [diggers],\" Kinka says. \"We do it with people in waders.\" Sometimes a few BDAs can raise the water table enough to get a real beaver to move in and take over.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here on Beaver Creek, this hard work wasn't necessary. What excites Kinka about the recovery here is its simplicity. \"We didn't go down there, we didn't reintroduce beavers, we didn't build BDAs. We didn't do anything,\" he tells me. \"We just put bison here. This is resilience that is inherent in the system. It just needed a little bit of a break from grazing to be able to do this all on its own.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "What's more, the creek is still improving, he says. \"Every year the creek gets a little wider, a little more meandery, a little more like a pool and less like a trench.\"\n",
